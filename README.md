## Project Proposal - Video Game Database
We desire to create a database for the GDC, which catalogues all of the games they have thier collection.
- Users can lookup, request games they desire the club to get or request games they want to see at upcoming events.
- There will be a mySQL database on the server hosted by GDC that users will be able to push and pull to for information on the games.
- Contact form for the club for users to submit comments or other concerns.
- Each game will have its own page which will feature specific information, some of which will be supplied by an external database (rawg.io). 
- Schedule of upcoming events for the club
