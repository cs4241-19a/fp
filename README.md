__Evaluation:__ 

Person 1: The GROUP button in navigation page should only exist in the index.html. Because other pages do not have group standing div, it is a useless button in other pages.

Person 2: The Match pages should contain the information of the player, people will not know who is this guy if there are only numbers.

Person 3: The Match page looks good, but it does not show any content to analyze the passing. In the home page, the element of group standings look not identical.

Person 4: The team page is great except if you guys can change the click to the division to scroll smoothly to that division.

Person 5: The team page show a lot of information but it seems blank on the right side of the team member. Also in the player pages some of the content are not showing.

The website is to show the information of European Championship League. It will show a few famous players and famous teams. Also it will show some matches with data visualization.

We designed a navigation bar with jquery and javascript, it can show links and images. when you hover it, a sub navigation list will show up with fade in effect. Also the navigation bar is fixed. In the navigation bar, there is a group element. When you click it, it will scroll down to the group standings section with jquery.

We set the background of the jumbotron a preset height related to the height of your browser. For example, if you screen height is 768px, the jumbotron's height will be 768px, if your screen height changed to 568px, the height of jumbotron will also changed to 568px;

We created a table to show the group standings. We used nested table to show all of them with images and designs.

We desigend a TEAM page to show the information of eight teams. The page have two parts, one is the left bar, the other is the contents. The left bar show's every teams with title. When you click one of the team in the left bar, a sub-list will show and when you click it it will scroll down to that section.
