## Decription

Since we are bot CS and IMGD double majors, we wanted to make a game that will serve as a portfolio piece using the mini-game engine Perlenspiel, which was by WPI's very own Professor Brian Moriarty: https://perlenspiel.net/

Our original goal was to created our ownversion of the Impossible Game:

However, as we began implementing our idea, we realized that our game was more similar to T-REX Run:

***Our Game (as your score increases, so does the speed of the obstacles!)

While the game was important, our biggest goal was to create a project that allowed users to create their own accounts and have their scores saved and placed in a leaderboard, which we were able to accomplish as seen below.

## Additional Instructions

As mentioned before, our application allows users to either login or sign up, however, if you do not wish to creare an account you can use one of our default accounts: 

Username: jack
Password: secret 

However, we heavily encourage you to create your own account so you can keep track of your score!

## Challenges

In the front-end side, we wanted to challenge ourselves to create a "good-looking" website without using any CSS Framework, and we think we were very successful!
