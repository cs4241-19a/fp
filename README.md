Project: Doughboyz Catering Application

Users: Customers looking to order a breakfast food

Stakeholders: Doughboyz company owners looking to streamline the ordering process.

Our final project will be a web application for a food catering service. The Doughboyz catering application will be a secure tool for customers to order the various menu items. The database and authentication services will allow customers to securely place an order and allow for administrative users to access that information in order to fulfill requests. Twilio will be used to help maintain order requests. The application will try to be a full experience application for users with accessibility, usability, comfortability thought about in the development of the user interface.  Visulatations in some capacity will be used for customers to preview their order. Requirement elicitation from users will be gathering in order to determine the best features for the application.

The goal of this application is for customers to order foods form the app. Customers can place an order and also use the 
visualizer to see what there order would look like with different condiments. 

To fully use the site you should login by first signing up by making a username and password.

**Important:** The account linked to the text confirmation portion of the application only has 7 more texts it is able to send before the account locks
and it won't be able to send them anymore. So use them wisely.

Technologies Used:
Three.js-Justin This library was used to develop visualizations of customers orders where the suer can choose different menu items and add toppings onto their order. 
The color of the visulization changes with the condiment
javascript-Tyrone JS was used to implment the backend of server componets, access the database, and the button functinality on the homepage
Jquerry/DataTables-Justin Datatables was used to visaualize the information put in the database 
Bootstrap-Justin Used to make the client pages look clewan and easy for the customers to use
lowDB-Tyrone Used to implment the server of the application for various requests used through the site
TextMagic Rest Client-This module allows you to send and recieve sms messages from the server. It requires an account to be created on their website and only gives you
10 messages you can send before you have to pay. The account is given its own phone number which the messages send from and we send the texts to whatever
number is specified by the user in their order.
NodeMailer-Nodemailer is a module that makes it very easy to send emails. We created a new gmail address (doughboys.official@gmail.com) to send our emails from and we send
them to whatever email the user specifies in their order.

The entire project was somewhat challenging. Justin struggled with backend development and Tyronne struggled with front end development.
Luckily we helped each other with our weak areas but getting data to store in the database was especially challenging.  

This project deserves a 100 because we not only spent hours working on the implmentation of the technologies, we asked various 
stakeholders features that they would like to have in a ordering application. From their feedback we established using Twello 
to send confirmations to users phones or emails would be a desirable feature. This project also made the application a bit smoother
adding more Bootstrap, cleaning up backend code, and adding more funcinality to the ordering page. This application can fully be used
to take orders from customers by storing them in a succinct database. The work and effort shown in this project is over 20 hours of 
programming in the last weeks.
