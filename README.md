Designed 

The website is to show the information of European Championship League. It will show a few famous players and famous teams. Also it will show some matches with data visualization.

designed a navigation bar with jquery and javascript, it can show links and images. when you hover it, a sub navigation list will show up with fade in effect. Also the navigation bar is fixed. In the navigation bar, there is a group element. When you click it, it will scroll down to the group standings section with jquery.

set the background of the jumbotron a preset height related to the height of your browser. For example, if you screen height is 768px, the jumbotron's height will be 768px, if your screen height changed to 568px, the height of jumbotron will also changed to 568px;

created a table to show the group standings. We used nested table to show all of them with images and designs.

desigend a TEAM page to show the information of eight teams. The page have two parts, one is the left bar, the other is the contents. The left bar show's every teams with title. When you click one of the team in the left bar, a sub-list will show and when you click it it will scroll down to that section.

designed players pages. They have background images and a div that background is transparent to show the content of the player.

desigend matches pages. They have titles and links to the highlight of that game. They also contain a large section of soccer field. It show the number of passing that a player made, also show the passing route. Also it shows the information of a specific player when you hover it.  d3 is the library that been used to make visualization data.

designed a forum using mangodb. Users could sign in with their email addresss. Users will receive an active link to active the account. Users could post and edit what they think about the matches. Users could also change their phones and ID on the setting section.(i tried my best to solve the problem about deploying this function to the glitch however i couldn't figure this about. To run it locally, you have to let the mangodb run first and do npm install and npm start. then type localhost:3000. It will show the whole pages and the forum could be well functional running locally )


At the end:
I took this coures in 2017 in a term. Part of this porject is my previours project, however, in oder to add the forum part, i basically have to rewrite every serverfile and rearrange other files. the forum is the most difficult part of my project, i really glad that i could figure this out at the end. in the previouse project we dont have time and ability to finish the forum part. i really exacting that i could finish this part at the end of the term.
