Project: Doughboyz Catering Application

Users: Customers looking to order a breakfast food

Stakeholders: Doughboyz company owners looking to streamline the ordering process.

Our final project will be a web application for a food catering service. The Doughboyz catering application will be a secure tool for customers to order the various menu items. The database and authentication services will allow customers to securely place an order and allow for administrative users to access that information in order to fulfill requests. Twilio will be used to help maintain order requests. The application will try to be a full experience application for users with accessibility, usability, comfortability thought about in the development of the user interface.  Visulatations in some capacity will be used for customers to preview their order. Requirement elicitation from users will be gathering in order to determine the best features for the application.
