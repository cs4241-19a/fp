## Project Outline
The idea of our team is to create the 🔥🔥 ultimate 🔥🔥 final 💪 grade 💯 calculator for students 👩‍🎓  🎉  (sorry we've spent too much time on product hunt) which supports multiple categories, extra credit quizzes and projects, can save your data between sessions locally (if you're a privacy oriented) or online!, supports dropped assignments, tells you what your worst case possible grade will be, tells you what your best case grade will be, and different ranges for letter grades.

We are also looking forward to create a nice looking webapp as a user interface for entering the information. In addition, we will create a simplistic marketing page to advertise the app

For the frontend we will be using [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev), which is a Vue.js framework that enables the creation of Single Page Applications, Server Side Rendered webapps, and hybrid apps with a pre-configured and streamlined development and build process featuring tree shaking and hot module reloading, and comes with a suite of Material Design components

For the backend we will be using an express http server with a JSON API, powered by MongoDB hosted in an mongo atlas instance.




The idea of our team is to create the 🔥🔥 ultimate 💪 final grade calculator 🔥🔥 (sorry we've spent too much time on product hunt). This calclulator will sotre individual information for every user that uses it. These users can then list unlimited amount of classes, and then split the classes into and number of catagoires (ie: tests, quizes, projects, ect.). They will then be able to say what precent each catagory into what percent of the final grade that catagoy is responsable for. Then in each catagory the user can list any amount of things that will be graded, say the maximum points that can be earned and how many points it will be out of (these are not the same due to some assignments giving extra credit). On the website you can enter what grades you have and the website will tell you your current grade, maximum possible final grade, and minimum possible final grade. We will also do market reasurch and learn of any other option features that might be important. There will also be support for features like x number of grades in a catagory droped, or if an assignment is purly extra credit that can be toggled as well.

Priorities:
  - (last) support offline session savings

Stretch Goals:
  - Marketing website / landing page to promote our creation
