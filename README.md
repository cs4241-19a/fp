The goal of this application is for customers to order foods form the app. Customers can place an order and also use the 
visualizer to see what there order would look like with different condiments. 

To fully use the site you should login by first signing up by making a username and password.

**Important:** The account linked to the text confirmation portion of the application only has 7 more texts it is able to send before the account locks
and it won't be able to send them anymore. So use them wisely.

Technologies Used:
Three.js-Justin
javascript-Tyrone 
Jquerry/DataTables-Justin
Bootstrap-Justin
lowDB-Tyrone 
TextMagic Rest Client-Tyrone
NodeMailer-Tyrone

The entire project was somewhat challenging. Justin struggled with backend development and Tyronne struggled with front end development.
Luckily we helped each other with our weak areas but getting data to store in the database was especially challenging.  

This project deserves a 100 because we not only spent hours working on the implmentation of the technologies, we asked various 
stakeholders features that they would like to have in a ordering application. From their feedback we established using Twello 
to send confirmations to users phones or emails would be a desirable feature. This project also made the application a bit smoother
adding more Bootstrap, cleaning up backend code, and adding more funcinality to the ordering page. This application can fully be used
to take orders from customers by storing them in a succinct database. The work and effort shown in this project is over 20 hours of 
programming in the last weeks.
