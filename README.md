Video Game Franchise Clicker

Team Members: Jarod Thompson, Cem Alemdar, Alp Piskin

We created a clicker game where you play as Link from Legend of Zelda and you are defeating monsters from various 
video game franchises. It has user login, a leaderboard based on saved user score, and the ability to load your progress
in the game as long as you remember your username and password. The game only saves your progress after you clear a level,
as seen in the upper left corner of the screen along with your current score and crit chance. We have pixi.js animations 
such as a slash for the attack and the damage popping up for every hit, and various calculations for
both attack and critical hit upgrades.

Jarod did all of the server interaction and some css, Cem did most of the css, pixi animations and some game calcs, Alp did 
most of the various game functions such as the attack power and crit rate.
