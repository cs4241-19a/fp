## Project Introduction
For the final project, our group developed a final grade calculator. As a user, you can add your class grades and grading policy in it and it will tell you your current grade as well as the highest/lowest grades. The system supports several different grading policies such as dropping, extra credit, top worth more, etc. It will store individual information for every user who uses it. Users also have the option to use it offline only or synchronize online.
