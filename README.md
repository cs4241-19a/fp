_Professor Roberts' Feedback:_

"This sounds really really useful! I don't have much experience using Live25 so I'm unclear how much effort it will take to integrate your software with this system. Do you have a backup plan / alternative feature to implement if Live25 integration proves to be too challenging? If you already know this won't be a problem, then you're good to go!" - Charlie Roberts

## General description (with Professor Roberts's feedback):

Your project should consist of a complete Web application, exhibiting facets of the three main sections of the course material:

- Static Web page content and design. You should have a project that is accessible, easily navigable, and features significant content.
- Dynamic behavior implemented with JavaScript.
- Server-side programming *using Node.js*. Typically this will take the form of some sort of persistent data, authentication, and possibly server-side computation.

Additionally, you should incorporate features that you independently research, design, and implement for your project.

## Project ideation (with Professor Roberts's feedback):

Excellent projects serve someone/some group; for this assignment you need to define your users and stakeholders. I encourage you to identify projects that will have impact, either artistically, politically, or in terms of productivity. Consider creating something useful for a cause or hobby you care about.
