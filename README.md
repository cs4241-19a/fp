### _Professor Roberts' Feedback on the Proposal:_

"This sounds really really useful! I don't have much experience using Live25 so I'm unclear how much effort it will take to integrate your software with this system. Do you have a backup plan / alternative feature to implement if Live25 integration proves to be too challenging? If you already know this won't be a problem, then you're good to go!" - Charlie Roberts

### How We Implemented His Feedback:

After reviewing Professor Robert's feedback, we decided to focus our project entirely on the room booking service, since that would be quite a coding challenge and have the most positive impact on our users and stakeholders, defined below. 

## Final Project Description (with Professor Roberts's feedback):

#### Users: WPI students and faculty who are in project teams and need a private space to meet with their teams.

#### Stakeholders: Admin controlling application, Manasi, Carla, Amanda, Sylvia, WPI faculty, and WPI students. 

### General Description: 

We create a project management tool that enables WPI students to effectively meet with their IQP teams at a convenient time and place on campus. We implemented these key features in our project management dashboard:

  1)  An availability tool that enables users to log in/register and enter/select which days and times of the week they are able to meet with their particular group for a particular room through a form.
  
  2)  A tool that enables groups to book meeting rooms on campus that are not already booked. They are also able to delete meetings they have booked through their account.
  
  3)  A tool that sends an email to recipients through our application to share booking details and provide confirmation. It is pretty cool.
  
  4)  A visual table display of rooms that are already booked for particular times. The table is udpated to even include the times you have booked rooms for and block those off so no other user can book that time.
  
  5)  A visual table that shows the user's meetings and enables them to delete meetings they have booked.
 
#### Impact:

As students who have worked on large group projects and IQP teams, we know how difficult and how confusing it can be to use 25live to find empty meeting spaces on campus. Our application addresses this issue and provides a solution that enable teams to find a time and place to interact and accomplish their team goals.

## Technical Requirements Accomplished and More!:

Our project is a complete web application:

- Our project has static web page content and design. It is accessible, easily navigable, and features significant content.
- Our project showcases dynamic behavior implemented with JavaScript.
- Our project uses Node.js, uses persistent data and implements authentication through login and register functionalities.
- Our project implements middleware and server-side computations.
- Our project implements a form that lets users add, view and populate data in a table and lod data from other users' account to show which rooms are already booked.
- Our project lets users delete their bookings from their list of meetings.

### Fun Features that we independently researched, designed, and implemented:

We had to research may components of our application and found resources on Stack Overflow, w3schools, tutorial points, and YouTube.

One of our favorite features to research was:

- nodemailer: which enabled us to send emails from our specialized team gmail account that notified recipents of the day, start time, end time, and location of their scheduled meeting.
