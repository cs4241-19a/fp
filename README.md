# cs4241-FinalProject yo

For your final project, you'll implement a course project that exhibits your mastery of the course materials. 
Similar to A4, this project gives you an opportunity to be creative and to pursue individual research and learning.

## General description

Your project should consist of a complete Web application, exhibiting facets of the three main sections of the course material:

- Static Web page content and design. You should have a project that is accessible, easily navigable, and features significant content.
- Dynamic behavior implemented with JavaScript.
- Server-side programming. Typically this will take the form of some sort of persistent data, authentication, and possibly server-side computation.

Additionally, you should incorporate features that you independently research, design, and implement for your project.

## Project ideation

Excellent projects serve someone/some group; for this assignment you need to define your users and stakeholders. I encourage you to identify projects that will have impact, either artistically, politically, or in terms of productivity. Consider creating something useful for a cause or hobby you care about.

### Deliverables

__Proposal:__ 
Provide an outline of your project direction and the names of the team members. 
The outline should have enough detail so that staff can determine if it meets the minimum expectations, or if it goes too far to be reasonable by the deadline.
This file must be named proposal.md so we can find it.
Submit a PR to turn it in by Monday, September 30th, before class

There are no other scheduled checkpoints for your project. 
You must be done in time to present before the final project demo day (October 10th). 

#### Turning in Your Outline / Project

**NOTE: code is due before the project presentation day due to the end of term / grading schedule constraints**
Submit a second PR on the final project repo to turn in your app and code.

Deploy your app, in the form of a webpage, to Glitch/Heroku/Digital Ocean or some other service.
Folks on the same team do not need to post the same webpage, but must instead clearly state who is on the team in their proposal.
(Staff will use the proposal to build the grading sheet.)

## Final Presentation

Presentations will occur during the final day of class.

## FAQs

- **Can I use XYZ framework?** You can use any web-based frameworks or tools available.
