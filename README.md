## Scheduler

https://fp-start.glitch.me

This is an application that allows for users to schedule meetings, and assign tasks to users for each meeting that they have created.

Logins:
Create a login on the signup page, or login with a sample user:
Username: UserTwo
Password: Pass

Features of the application include:

- Passport authentication for users.
- A sqlite3 database for users, messages, tasks, and meetings.
- Seperate pages for allowing users to view meetings, make meetings, assign tasks, and view their own messages and tasks.
- Messages that are automatically stored for users to notify them when they are assigned or unassigned from a task.
- A canvas display for the current month on the calendar that is being looked up.
- Bootstrap styling for each page.

The main challenge faced in the project was in ensuring that the relationships between seperate pages and tables in the
database were able to be accessed properly.

Work done for each person:
Peter made most of the server and scripts for each page.
Tom worked on the calendar display on the main page.
Rosana did most of the styling on the individual pages, and came up with some of the extensions to the task displays.
