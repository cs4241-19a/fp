## Project Outline
The idea of our team is to create the 🔥🔥 ultimate 💪 final grade calculator 🔥🔥 🎉 (sorry we've spent too much time on product hunt) which supports multiple categories, extra credit quizzes and projects, can save your data between sessions locally (if you're a privacy oriented) or online!, supports dropped assignments, tells you what your worst case possible grade will be, tells you what your best case grade will be, and different ranges for letter grades.

We are also looking forward to create a nice looking webapp as a user interface for entering the information. In addition, we will create a simplistic marketing page to advertise the app
