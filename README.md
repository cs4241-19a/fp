## General description
 For our final project, we would like create a web application where the user signs in and takes a quiz. From that quiz they can then put in a workout they plan to do, and the website will give them a playlist that will last the length of the workout, match the intesity of the workout, and is in genres that the user likes. The playlist will then be added to their spotify playlists if they sign in with their spotify account.

 ##Tech used
 We used firebase to create a database that would take in some parameters put in from the user, and then output a list of songs that suited those parameters. For example, a workout playlist of low intensity, country and 20 minutes, will output a playlisy for 20 minutes that meets those other two requirments. The user is also able to click on a link that refers to the spotify website to also see the song there.
 
 ##Challenges
 We tried to use the spotify API but unfortunatly ran into some trouble so we had to create our own database for the songs listed for each possible playlist. Because of this we were able to put a link so the user could open it with Spotify.


#Contributions
Trevor: Incorporation of Firebase and making the database connect to the app, as well as upload a playlits.
