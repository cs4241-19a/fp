## Project Outline
The idea of our team is to create the 🔥🔥 ultimate 💪 final grade calculator for students 👩‍🎓 🔥🔥 🎉  (sorry we've spent too much time on product hunt) which supports multiple categories, extra credit quizzes and projects, can save your data between sessions locally (if you're a privacy oriented) or online!, supports dropped assignments, tells you what your worst case possible grade will be, tells you what your best case grade will be, and different ranges for letter grades.

We are also looking forward to create a nice looking webapp as a user interface for entering the information. In addition, we will create a simplistic marketing page to advertise the app

For the frontend we will be using [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev), which is a Vue.js framework that enables the creation of Single Page Applications, Server Side Rendered webapps, and hybrid apps with a pre-configured and streamlined development and build process featuring tree shaking and hot module reloading, and comes with a suite of Material Design components

For the backend we will be using an express http server with a JSON API, powered by MongoDB hosted in an mongo atlas instance.

Priorities:
  - (last) support offline session savings

Stretch Goals:
  - Marketing website / landing page to promote our creation
