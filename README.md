<p>
This is an application that allows a user to become the host of a room. Attendants who join this room can then anonymously 
  ask questions to the host, as well as vote on questions other attendants have posted. The host can then look at 
  these questions and delete them from the list as they are resolved. The questions are sorted by number of upvotes.
  The list regularly and automatically refreshes to add newly asked questions and update the upvotes on existing questions. 
 </p>
 
 <p>
 To use this program, hosts and attendees alike must first create an account. Then they may enter their credentials to log in.
 The slider below allows users to toggle whether they wish to log in as a host or as an attendee.
 </p>
 <p>
When a host logs in, the server will automatically provide and display a unique code for that room. Attendees may then enter this code
to join the room, enabling them to post questions to be displayed on the host's screen. Hosts are encouraged to show their display to their
attendees, which will display incoming questions.
</p>
<p>
Attendees can upvote any questions posted to their room. Questions will then be regularly and automatically sorted according to the number of
votes. This allows for important questions that attendees are most interested in to be rise to the top of the list, and ideally, be resolved first.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>
Working in a group proved to be a challenge at some points since we had to constantly ensure that team members were not working over each other.  
  This was especially true when one person tried to test the server while the other made changes. Some members had also adopted 
  packages and practices unfamiliar to the rest of the team, so each member had to also adapt to each other's practices. Additionally,
  our schedules did not match up well, so having meetings was slightly difficult.
</p>

<h2>Ideas</h2>
<p>
Due to time constraints, there where several features that we thought of adding but didn't have the chance to do so.
We thought of making a question counter, as well as a button that is able to clear all questions to provide hosts with several tools to work with.
</p>
<p>
The program currently allows users to upvote the same question multiple times; to fix this we considered having questions track which users
have already upvoted them so that the server could then block subsequent upvotes.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we had planned to allow the hosts and attendees to flag disruptive questions, as well as a feature that allows hosts to
kick or ban undesired attendees from their room.
