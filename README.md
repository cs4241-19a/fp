### _Professor Roberts' Feedback on the Proposal:_

"This sounds really really useful! I don't have much experience using Live25 so I'm unclear how much effort it will take to integrate your software with this system. Do you have a backup plan / alternative feature to implement if Live25 integration proves to be too challenging? If you already know this won't be a problem, then you're good to go!" - Charlie Roberts

### How We Implemented His Feedback:

## Final Project Description (with Professor Roberts's feedback):

#### Users:

#### Stakeholders:

### General Description: 

We plan to create a project management tool that enables WPI students to effectively meet with their IQP teams at a convenient time and place on campus. We plan to implement two key features in our project management dashboard:

  1) An availability tool that enables users to log in and enter/select which days and times of the week they are able to meet with their particular group. 
  
  2) A tool that enables groups to book meeting rooms on campus that are not already booked
 
#### Impact

As students who have worked on large group projects and IQP teams, we know how difficult it can be to find overlapping availabilities to meet and how confusing it can be to use 25live to find empty meeting spaces on campus. Our application addresses these two issues and provides a solution that enable teams to find a time and place to interact and accomplish their team goals.


## Technical Requirements Accomplished and More!:

Your project should consist of a complete Web application, exhibiting facets of the three main sections of the course material:

- Static Web page content and design. You should have a project that is accessible, easily navigable, and features significant content.
- Dynamic behavior implemented with JavaScript.
- Server-side programming *using Node.js*. Typically this will take the form of some sort of persistent data, authentication, and possibly server-side computation.

Additionally, you should incorporate features that you independently research, design, and implement for your project.
