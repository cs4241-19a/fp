Deliverables
---
1) A static webpage that contributes to a research project here at WPI.
2) Dynamic javascript behavior - filling html tags dynamically, and creating them dynamically as well.
3) A server that routes to two different client side files and provides data from two different databases.

Technical Achievements
---
1) Implemented MongoDB - https://fp-arundelain-kroyer.glitch.me
2) Used Tracery and jquery to create and use a grammar, used a module for FileServer,
used mongoDB, node.js, body-parser, css
3) Dynamically created divs using javascript, created a server that also acted as a router for my pages.
4) Utilised two client side javascript files to created the interactivity with the server.
5) Accessed the information from the dynamic divs to output to an external file via a saveas button.
6) Accessed two individual database collections to get an editable list of data for the initial page
and a list of grammar rules for the second page.
7) Filtered my array data for html code and removed it prior to sending to the FileServer module.

This project supports ongoing research at WPI. I am working with a group of people including
Professor Gillian Smith, Professor Anne Sullivan, Trusting Inekwe, Aidan Buffam and others to
provide an opportunity to quilters who may feel intimidated by learning programming. 
We are attempting to decide between using a grammar or using traditional javascript or some 
combination to offer a unique way for quilters to approach their hobbies.
