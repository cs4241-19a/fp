## Login Information
- **Landlord**: janette (username), janette1 (password)
- **Tenant**: ccheng (username), 123 (password)
- Or register yourself

## Purpose
To develop a web application that allows for landlords and tenants to communicate, and view upcoming events and payments. 

## Requirements Satisfied

Your project should consist of a complete Web application, exhibiting facets of the three main sections of the course material:

- Static Web page content and design. You should have a project that is accessible, easily navigable, and features significant content. ✔
- Dynamic behavior implemented with JavaScript. ✔
- Server-side programming *using Node.js*. Typically this will take the form of some sort of persistent data, authentication, and possibly server-side computation. ✔
- Incorporate features that you independently research, design, and implement for your project. ✔

## Features
- **Login/Register** - Passport authentication
- **Server and database** - Express, lowdb, node.js
- **Landlord and Tenant Views** - Javascript, HTML, and Bootstrap for CSS 
- **Schedule** - Landlords can create new events to add to the calendar
- **Calendar** - Displays events related to each user
- **Manage Apartments** - Landlords can manage keys/apartments
- **Contact** - Tenants and view contact information
- **Payment** - Tenants can view their bills and navigate to PayPal

## Challenges
Some challenges we faced was scoping the project and time management. When the team members met to discuss ideas for the final project, we brainstormed many different features and soon realized most of these features would be too out of scope for the project because we only had 1.5 weeks to implement it. In addition, all the team members had other classes and time commitments so we had to make sure to prioritize time for implementing this final project. We made sure to keep the features down to what we can accomplish within the timeframe and deliver a successful product. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Side Tabs for Multiple Views (Technical)**: We wanted the user to be able to click tabs on the side and have the main window display the necessary information, which required us to utilize tags wisely for both the landlord and tenant views.
- **Related databases**: We had to construct multiple databases to link common features together, so we can ensure that the correct data is being displayed for the user.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Side Tabs for Multiple Views (Design)**: The side tabs are a nice design choice because it allows us to organize everything neatly in one page and don't require redirecting.
- **CSS from scratch**: We created mockups so we applied our CSS skills from scratch to achieve our desired design.
