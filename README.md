# cs4241-FinalProject

##Soundcloudish

So the plan of this project is to develop a soundcloud like platform. The application will support multiple users, each with their credentials authenticated by passport and all the
data attached to that user stored in Firebase. 

Users can be searched and when they are, a portfolio for them will be displayed. This portfolio will display songs uploaded by them and different visualizers for each song. 
For each song, there will be a media player to allow the user to play, pause, fast-forward and backward. Users can select different visualizations to go with the song. Songs can 
be liked and disliked.

Each logged in user can access their own portfolio and edit it as they see fit. They can upload songs, control what visualizations are available, edit the aspects of the visualization,
the order in which the songs appear. They can also edit their profile, like add a photo, have an about me section, link to social media. 

I will be hardcoding all the html and css for this project and using an express server in node.js. For the visualizations I will use the Web Audio API and three.js.
