# cs4241-FinalProject: qMe by Terry Hearst, Demi Karavoussianis, Kyle Reese, and Tom White
Welcome to qMe! qMe is a priority queue application for use in personal scheduling. Any user can create an account with qMe. With an account created, users can enter tasks that they need to complete. Depending on the difference between how long each task will take and how long until each task is due, qMe will queue the tasks in order of importance to be working on at whatever moment a user accesses their tasks. Additional ranking is done among similarly ranked tasks by a high, medium, or low priority assigned by the user to each task. Once a task is completed, it can be checked off as the user continues to their next task.
