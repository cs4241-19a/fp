<h1>Final Project for Webware</h1>
<p>Team Members: Kristen Andonie, Noble Kalish, Cooper Bennet</p>

<h3>Outline:<h3>
<ul>
    <li>We want to create a html game that uses pixijs</li>
    <li>The game will be a platformer that has a time limit attached to it</li>
    <li>The game will track the time for each user and display it in a leaderboard</li>
    <li>There will be an authentication for each user using passport</li>
    <li>Each user will be able to track their own times and try and beat them</li>
    <li>We will deploy this app using heroku and using their supplied database which is a sql based database</li>
    <li>We will use dat.gui to allow users to login if they want to and go to the leaderboard if they want to</li>
</ul>
