# cs4241-FinalProject Proposal 
Matthew Adiletta (mjadiletta@wpi.edu), Alexander Rus (anrus@wpi.edu)

## General description
For the final project of CS4241 we would like to make a multiplayer "tiny tanks" game. This project would work off of the ideas from a previous project one of us worked on with various new features.

The project would allow multiple players from different computers to join the game server and compete against eachother. We would like to implement:
- Mulitple playable levels
- A login service
- The ability to create an account in which users can change different aspects of their tanks and look at stats
- A leaderboard system
- An "options" system that allows users to change control settings and graphic settings
- Something else cool
