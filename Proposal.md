## Project Outline
The idea of our team is to create the 🔥🔥 ultimate 🔥🔥 final 💪 grade 💯 calculator 🧮 for students 👩‍🎓  🎉  (sorry we've spent too much time on product hunt). This calculator will store individual information for every user who uses it. These users can then list unlimited amount of classes, and then split the classes into and number of catagories (ie: tests, quizes, projects, etc.). They will then be able to say what precentage each catagory counts toward final grade. In each catagory, the user can list any amount of things that will be graded, say the maximum points that can be earned and how many points it will be out of (these are not the same due to some assignments giving extra credit). On the website, users can enter what grades they have and the website will tell them their current grade, maximum possible final grade, and minimum possible final grade. We will also do market research and learn of any other optional features that might be vital to a~~n addictive~~ good user experience. There will also be support for features like # number of lowest grades in a catagory droped, or if an assignment is purly extra credit that can be toggled as well.

We are also looking forward to create a nice looking webapp as a user interface for entering the information. In addition, we plan to create a simplistic marketing page to advertise the app.

For the frontend we will be using [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev), which is a Vue.js framework that enables the creation of Single Page Applications, Server Side Rendered webapps, and hybrid apps with a pre-configured and streamlined development and build process featuring tree shaking and hot module reloading, and comes with a suite of Material Design components.

For the backend we will be using an express http server with a JSON API, powered by MongoDB hosted in an mongo atlas instance.

Stretch Goals:
  - Marketing website / landing page to promote our creation
  - Hook up to an analytics service
  - Add SMS reminders to add grades every week
  - Add email reminders
  - support offline session savings
