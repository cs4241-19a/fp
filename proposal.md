We are planning on making a cookie clicker game for our final project.

Our initial concept is you play a hero, and every click on the screen swipes
his sword, doing damage to the current enemy on the screen. The enemy dies after 
a certain number of hits, with damage numbers appearing on the screen, and a new
enemy rushes in to attack the hero. Killing each enemy will give the player money
to buy upgrades, and enemies will get progressively harder.
We will require user authentication to make an account so we can keep track of their highscores in
various stats within a database.
