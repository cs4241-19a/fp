This project will be developed independently by myself, Jeffrey Xiao. It is a continuation of the A4 project in which I 
developed an online rhythm game, "A Bard's Tale." For the final project, I want to polish and further develop the game, 
adding basic features such as animations and an improved user interface as well as user login and a global leaderboard.
I would also like to take the opportunity to add game mechanics such as a health bar and mana bar which the user can 
spend to cast spells that would boost aspects of the game such as increasing life points and increasing the score 
multiplier. I would also like to increase the possible types of notes to include held notes and "bomb" notes(which the 
player must avoid triggering). As a stretch goal, I would like to increase the number of songs and add a "song creator"
mode which would allow a player to create their own "song maps." I would also like to have a simple "shop" in which 
players might be able to purchase new songs and spells. Finally, I would like to experiment with technologies such as 
the Leap Motion, an infrared sensor which can detect hand gestures, and the DDR Dance Pad, the home version of the 
classic arcade dance pad used to play the original DDR games.
