## Proposal for six-pact

#### Team Members
- Kit Zellerbach
- Petra Kumi

#### Outline
We propose a web app called six-pact. It is an app that will facilitate weight loss competitions within groups.
Users can be part of "six-pacts", which are essentially groups containing members who are striving for weight loss or 
fitness goals. The app uses the competitive nature of human beings, especially within groups, to motivate one another.
The app will make use of a dashboard layout using principles from material design. Planned features include dynamic graphs,
mobile compatibility, integrated machine learning, user accounts, notifications and email reminders, global and local leaderboards,
chat rooms, blob storage.


### Technical details
- Framework: Angular CLI
- Database: MongoDB or Firebase (both json and blob storage)
- Server: Node.js
- Middleware: Passport or FirebaseAuth
- Other libraries: D3.js, Three.js, Babylon.js, Tensorflow.js (most likely will be more)
- Other components: Flask python server for backend machine learning code
