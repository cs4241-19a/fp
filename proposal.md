## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a web application that will allow for much easier management of the house job system for AXP. The project will be deployed onto the server in our main house and used to more effectively communicate and track house jobs as well as the underlying point system that governs them. 

## Base Features

- Automatic Job Assignment
  - Automatically assigns jobs to users based on the point system of the application
- Job Tracker
  - Displays current list of assigned jobs with corresponding users
  - Admin users will be able to manually overrid/add jobs as they see fit
  - Jobs will be color coded to indicate what state they are in (completed, missed, or pending)
- Point System
  - Tracks the points of all users to determine who is assigned house jobs
  - Tracks the status of jobs previously assigned to users
  - Users will be able to see a readout of their own points and statistics
- Admin Contact
  - Users will be able to send messages to admins through an excuse mailbox


## Stretch Features

- Private Messages
  - User messaging may be upgraded to allow for PMs between users to coordinate swapping jobs
- Email Functionality
  - The application may be able to send emails to notify users when they are assigned a house job
- Live Chatbox
  - Messages may be incorporated into a live chatbox for users
- Full job history
  - The application may be able to display a user's full history of jobs from a given date onwards
