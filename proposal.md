##Final Project##

Our final project proposal is to create a website utilising the Spotify web API,
to have a user search for an artist or a song, add it to a persistant database,
and to visualize data about the search using the Google Maps API.

The Spotify Web API not only allows us to authenticate a user with their spotify account,
but we can query anything in the Spotify database, including individual songs, artists, albums, etc.

Also, we can access song data including but not limited to: most listened to in countries, song loudness,
artist popularity and information.

We want to try and visualize an artist or songs top 10 countries in the world that they are most listened to
by using the Google Maps API.

Lastly, as an extra feature, we want to try and have the songs queued able to play to the browser and be controlled
by the user.
