_Computer Science Schedule Tracker_
For our Final Project, we plan on implementing an online computer science tracking sheet for WPI CS students.

## This tracking sheet project will feature:
- HTML static pages and validations for form input, as well as for the tracking sheet interface itself.
- A login feature, which allows users to log in and edit/produce their own personal tracking sheets.
- A Node.js SQLite database which hold all of the login and shcedule info for all users. In addition, all class info (and what they count towards) will be stored as well.
- Dynamic Javascript that will implement selectors and buttons for selecting classes that meet particular degree requirements.
- Javascript to interact (add/modify/remove) with the database. 
- Tracking sheet/schedule presets, which will allow users to populate their tracking sheet based on concentrations or interests (ex: Cybersecurity).

## Goals for this Project:
- Create an easier tracking-sheet experience for evalutating degree completion and planning.
- Allow younger students to be able to plan their courses in the long-term, even before the exact terms of when those classes are offered is determined.
