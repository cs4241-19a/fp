# cs4241-FinalProject

__Proposal:__ 

Daniel Caffrey, Rafael Pimentel, Javier Marcos, Paris Lopez

Our idea is to create a web application that allows students to ask the professor questions anonymously in class, and the professor can read these questions on their own computer to answer them based on either chronological order or the question with the most upvotes. The student can see all questions but only delete their own; whereas the teacher would be able to resolve any answered questions. There would be two separate UIâ€™s for the teacher and students, and multiple students would be able to ask questions at the same time.

This is just a basic idea of what we would like to do, should there be any other features added to increase the complexity of the project?

Provide an outline of your project direction and the names of the team members. 
The outline should have enough detail so that staff can determine if it meets the minimum expectations, or if it goes too far to be reasonable by the deadline.
This file must be named proposal.md so we can find it.
Submit a PR to turn it in by Monday, September 30th, before class

There are no other scheduled checkpoints for your project. 
You must be done in time to present before the final project demo day (October 10th).
