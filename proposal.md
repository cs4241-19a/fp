### Our Idea 
Since we are bot CS and IMGD double majors, we want to make a game that will serve as a portfolio piece using the mini-game engine Perlenspiel, which
was by WPI's very own Professor Brian Moriarty: https://perlenspiel.net/

For now, our goal is to created our version of the Impossible Game/Geometry Dash (examples linked below). We want to implement a leaderboard using lowdb 
to maintain the data. We also want to use passport to allow users to create their own accounts and keep track of their scores.

We are using express as our application framework.
