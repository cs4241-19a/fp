### Deliverables

__Proposal:__ 
We plan to create a project management tool that enables IQP teams to effectively meet together at a convenient time and place. We plan to implement two key feautures in our project management dashboard:

  1) An availability tool that enables users to log in and enter/select which days and times of the week they are able to meet with their particular group.
  
  2) A tool that enables groups to book meeting rooms on campus that are not already booked
 
 As students who have worked on large group projects and IQP teams ourselves, we know how difficult it can be to find overlapping availabilities to meet and how confusing it can be to use 25live to find empty meeting spaces on campus. Our application addresses these two issues and provides a solution that enable teams to find a time and place to interact their team and accomplish their team goals.
