_Online **Codenames** Multiplayer Game_
For our Final Project, we plan on implementing an online version of the card game _codenames_ which will allow users to play together online and create their own cards and play styles.

## This project will feature:
- HTML static pages and validations for form input to prevent duplicate cards
- A login feature, which allows users to log in and edit/produce their own personal card decks.
- A Node.js SQLite database which hold all of the login and card deck info for all users.
- Dynamic Javascript that will implement selectors and buttons for selecting and making cards in game as well as communicating with teammates (if necessary) 
- Javascript to interact (add/modify/remove) with the database. 
- Card presets, which will allow users to play the game without needing to create their own deck (if they so choose)

## Goals for this Project:
- Create a fun interactive game that people can play online.
- Utilize web sockets to allow for realtime communication between players, browser, and the server.
- Allow players customization options for the game that paying with cards in real life does not offer.
