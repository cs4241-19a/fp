# cs4241-FinalProject

__Proposal:__ 

Daniel Caffrey, Rafael Pimentel, Javier Marcos, Paris Lopez

Our idea is to create a web application that allows students to ask the professor questions anonymously in class, and the professor can read these questions on their own computer to answer them based on either chronological order or the question with the most upvotes. The student can see all questions but only delete their own; whereas the teacher would be able to resolve any answered questions. There would be two separate UIs for the teacher and students, and multiple students would be able to ask questions at the same time. These questions would update without the teacher needing to refresh the page.

As for the design, we will likely use our own css; but if we do not have time, we will apply a css template. We plan on creating this project iteratively by beginning with the basic concept and adding features of increasing complexity as we continue time permitting.
