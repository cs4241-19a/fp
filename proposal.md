# Proposal

Team members: Peter Jankowski, Tom Graham, Rosana Pochat

Project details:

We want to make a calendar application that allows for people to sign up, and set up meetings with other registered users. Our website will allow for people to set up task lists in advance of a meeting, assign tasks to users from a meetingâ€™s task list, and notify users as the meeting deadline approaches. We will also allow for users to adjust the look of the site when they are logged in.
