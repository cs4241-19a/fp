Natalie Bloniarz & Anagha Late

Our project is a simple garage band-esque music creator using the Perlenspiel game engine written by Professor Moriarty
Users will be able to create songs using a piano, drums, and triangle, and have them played back both on the individual instruments and together.
Created songs will be stored in a database and all users will be able to play every song in the database.
The instruments will be visually recreated for users to click to interact.

If we have enought time we will also impliment a piano tiles-esque game and keep track of high scores.
