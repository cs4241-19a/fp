## Project Overview

Our teams plan is to recreate [when2meet](www.when2meet.com) with some nice feature additions. The key improvement that we aim to add is the ability to save usersâ€™ availability in their profile to populate future meetings. The site will also be designed from the ground up to be responsive and useable on mobile.

### Base features:

- Allow users to create an event with a specified 
  - Name
  - Date range (either days of week or specific date)
  - Earliest possible time and latest possible time
- Allow users to fill out events that are sent to them
- Allow users to save their availability to use for multiple events (and allow future editing of base availability)
- View previously filled in event invites
- Mobile capabilities

### Stretch features:

- Invite people to meeting by email
- Import from .ical to auto populate fields
- Resolve meeting conflicts
- Allow event creator to send decided time to group

### Technologies used:

- React
- Bootstrap
- Server-side rendering
- Express
